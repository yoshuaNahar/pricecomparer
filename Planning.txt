Parts:
- Get all data from AH (JsonPath, Gson)
- Get all data from Jumbo (JSoup)


- Create the layer that will turn AhProduct data into classes for Hibernate to persist


- Create a Database and add a Hibernate model for it (Spring Boot JPA-Hibernate)
- Create the Repository Layer (Spring Boot REST)
- Create the Front-end (Angular)


Where am I:
- Write code to get Ah data to classes âœ“

- Create database that suites Hibernate
- Write code to get Ah data into my classes for Hibernate

    The issue currently is that my Hibernate database is not good.
    For example, my database can't deal with me adding a product that both
    Jumbo and AH sell (which is pretty much the whole idea of this app).



- Write code for other parts
