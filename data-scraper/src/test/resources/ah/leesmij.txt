Inside each ah json page there is a embedded with links to subcategory pages.
I need to check if it exists from the root/top level page till the deepest subcategory.

Quick ref:
ah-groente-page.json --> line 524 "productSrc": "Filters"
ah-groente-tomaatkomkommer-page.json --> line 494 "productSrc": "Filters"
ah-groente-tomatenkomkommer-tomaten-page.json --> line 726 "productSrc":"Filters" (has an empty filter, because it is the deepest subcategory)

Deleted it, because each page has a productCategoryNavigation
ah-product-page.json --> line 50 "productSrc": "productCategoryNavigation" (doesn't have a filter)
